 <p>Ferrari California T. Overview. The California T is Ferrari’s return to forced induction, but where the last turbo Ferrari was the beastly F40, the T is far tamer. It’s the softest in the Ferrari range, designed for daily ease and use—it even has a cupholder.
   The California was, at the time, the most aerodynamic Ferrari road car ever made until the introduction of the F12berlinetta . The California was manufactured in a purpose built facility that was constructed adjacent to the existing factory at Maranello.
</p>
<p>This is the result when engineers take an amazing street car, lower the weight and add horsepower. Debuted for the first time at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Ferrari 458 Speciale for sale holds the title for the top performing 458 cars. The Italian builder zeroed in on two aspects to give it an edge over the Italia: power and weight.
  The 2013 Ferrari 458 Speciale - abbreviated as Ferrari 458 S - is a RWD supercar by Ferrari that debuted in Forza Horizon 2 via the Top Gear Car Pack, and is featured in all subsequent main series titles as well as Forza Motorsport 6: Apex . It appears in Forza Motorsport 6 as VIP content .
